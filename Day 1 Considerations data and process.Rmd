# Day 1 Considerations on data and process

## *Way forward*

  - use stortingsscrape to create a dataset (structuring text data)
    - 2011 onwards
    - 1987 brundtland rapporten
  - count mentions of keywords (create keyword list)
    - 4.7
    - UBU
    - etc.
  - clean dataset and supervise algorithms to classify sentiments in mentions
  - three-stage process:
    1. counting words and achieving overview
    2. connecting words to cases and MPs
    3. supervised algorithm on sentiments 
  
  ## *To do*
  - message UNA about keywords/interests; main efforts and goals (how shall we measure their success - just mentions?)
  - ask UNA about specific "lovforslag" the lobbied
  
  ## *Data*
  - Data on decisions (case id, MP, mention)
